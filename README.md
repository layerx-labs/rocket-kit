# TAIKAI Design System

Built with [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/)

## Commands

TSDX scaffolds your new library inside `/src`, and also sets up a [Parcel-based](https://parceljs.org) playground for it inside `/example`.

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

> NOTE: Stories should reference the components as if using the library, similar to the example playground. This means importing from the root project directory. This has been aliased in the tsconfig and the storybook webpack config as a helper.

### Example

Then run the example inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

The default example imports and live reloads whatever is in `/dist`, so if you are seeing an out of date component, make sure TSDX is running in watch mode like we recommend above. **No symlinking required**, we use [Parcel's aliasing](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#aliases).

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Bundle analysis

Calculates the real cost of your library using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) with `npm run size` and visulize it with `npm run analyze`.

### Rollup

TSDX uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions

Two actions are added by default:

- `main` which installs deps w/ cache, lints, tests, and builds on all pushes against a Node and OS matrix
- `size` which comments cost comparison of your library on every pull request using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

## Optimizations

Please see the main `tsdx` [optimizations docs](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#optimizations). In particular, know that you can take advantage of development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('foo');
}
```

You can also choose to install and use [invariant](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#invariant) and [warning](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#warning) functions.

## Deploying the Example Playground

The Playground is just a simple [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) app, you can deploy it anywhere you would normally deploy that. Here are some guidelines for **manually** deploying with the Netlify CLI (`npm i -g netlify-cli`):

```bash
cd example # if not already in the example folder
npm run build # builds to dist
netlify deploy # deploy the dist folder
```

Alternatively, if you already have a git repo connected, you can set up continuous deployment with Netlify:

```bash
netlify init
# build command: yarn build && cd example && yarn && yarn build
# directory to deploy: example/dist
# pick yes for netlify.toml
```

## Publishing to Github Package Registry

We are using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np)

```bash
npm install --global np
```

### Get Github Personnal Access Token 

Follow this guide: 
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token 

you need the following scopes (read:packages, write:packages, delete:packages, repo). 

Once you get the TOKEN, you can login: 

```
$ npm login --scope=@OWNER --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

> Username: USERNAME
> Password: TOKEN
> Email: PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```
